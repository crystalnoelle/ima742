“For the first time in history, the human mind is a direct productive source"

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
Influencers are a example of the human mind becoming a productive source in that they post and generate content. 

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
"Where Influencers are most social"

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Generating content becomes a commodity for companies to capitalize off of.

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
“What we think and how we think becomes expressed in goods, services, material and intellectual output”

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
In our capitalist society, we use technology as a means of identifying ourselves through what we post. Even when that data is taken to make ads for us.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
Even through the development of technology, it had excluded marginalized groups. The internet started with ARPANET.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
But with the need to become inclusive, FIDONET was born to connect to those in countries with less accessibility. A sort of counterculture.
